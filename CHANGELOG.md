# Changelog

Release notes, newest first. `tools/release` takes each release's notes from
its section here.

## 0.1.0

The first release: Sunstone as a Debian package for Ubuntu 26.04 on amd64.

- Installs under `/opt/sunstone` with its own Python 3.15, with settings in
  `/etc/sunstone` and saved state in `/var/lib/sunstone/state`.
- `sudo sunstone self-update` installs a newer signed release in place, after
  backing up the configuration and state, and rolls back if the new version
  does not start; `--check`, `--version`, `--file`, and `--rollback` too.
- `sunstone check` loads the settings, topology, on-call directory, and saved
  files as the server would, and says what it found or what is wrong.
- Everything from the workshop prototype: the geographic, hierarchy, and
  topology views, live state and its history, problems and their impact,
  maintenance, on-call routing and paging, discovery against the
  documentation with fixes and expectations, and shift handovers, saved at
  each shift change and signed for by the incoming shift.
